# Ki67 Marker Detection in Kidney Cortex

This repository contains the code and resources for detecting Ki67 markers in the kidney cortex. The project involves several preprocessing steps, including normalization and registration, followed by glomeruli detection, cortex extraction, Ki67 marker identification, and quantification.

## Introduction

Ki67 is a nuclear protein that is associated with cellular proliferation. It is commonly used as a proliferation marker in cancer diagnostics and research. This project focuses on detecting and quantifying Ki67 markers in the kidney cortex, which is important for studying kidney diseases, particularly those involving changes in cell proliferation rate.

The project involves multiple stages:

1. **Preprocessing:** Enhancing image quality and alignment through normalization and registration.
2. **Processing:** Detecting and isolating glomeruli, and extracting the kidney cortex.
3. **Postprocessing:** Identifying Ki67 markers and quantifying the detected Ki67 markers to provide meaningful data for further analysis.

By automating these steps, this project aims to provide a robust and accurate method for Ki67 marker detection in specific kidney region.

## Features

- **Normalization and Registration:** Preprocessing techniques to enhance image quality and alignment.
- **Glomeruli Detection and Isolation:** Identifying and isolating glomeruli within kidney cortex images.
- **Cortex Extraction:** Extracting the cortex region for focused analysis.
- **Ki67 Marker Identification:** Detecting Ki67 markers within the extracted cortex.
- **Quantification:** Quantifying the presence of Ki67 markers.
